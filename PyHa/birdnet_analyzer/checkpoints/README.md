## BirdNET Analyzer Model Version History

This repository contains only the latest version of the BirdNET-Analyzer model. We will track the changes in this document and also provide permanent download links to previous versions for testing and/or other use cases. 

You can download and unzip previous model versions, make sure to update the `MODEL_PATH` and `LABELS_FILE` variable in the `config.py` file to the version you want to use.
